OpenVRI
=======

Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) based on WebRTC, a 3-way connection with video, audio, and texting real time

============================================================================================================

OpenVRI is based on WebRTC, and uses Node.js as the signaling channel to exchange SDP, and texting. 
You also need to include the adapter.js from Google.

A running example of the OpenVRI application can be found at openvri.com

The VRI application is meant to be installed into any web page using a one line embed div with script.

A note: The dialog jQuery UI was created from themeroller. Insert your theme in /public/stylesheets/.
